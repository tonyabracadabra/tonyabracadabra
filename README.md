### What I cannot create, I do not understand ðŸŒ 

I make Machine Learn.

I am currently the founder and CEO @ STRING, a platform that fosters decision making with the Blessing of Dimensionality through the causal lens. Before founding STRING, I was an engineer @ Uber / JD, after graduated from the coolest computer science school on earth where I was blessed to meet some of the smartest people I've met in the world.

I am currently living in Hangzhou @ China, I am open for a coffee â˜• chat if you are around! I always enjoy conversations with people with different background ðŸ˜„

Few more things:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning quantum computation and cryptography, along with many other crazily fun things (like analytic philosophy).
- ðŸ“š Apart from being an engineer, I was also trained as a biologist, chemist and an amateur linguist.
