### I make Machine Learn


I am currently the CEO and hacker @ STRING, a platform that fosters decision making with the Blessing of Dimensionality through the causal lens. Before founding STRING, I was an engineer @ Uber / JD, and before that, I attended the coolest computer science school on earth where my burning curiosity got ignited toward the universe, elegant yet preposterous, we reside.

I am currently living in Hangzhou @ China, I am always open for a coffee chat if you are around! I always enjoyed talking with people with different background.

Few more things:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning quantum computation and cryptography, along with many other crazily fun things (like analytic philosophy).
- ðŸ“š Apart from being an engineer, I was also trained as a biologist, chemist and an amateur linguist.
